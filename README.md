# *Brandon Leek*
## *Full Stack Web Developer - Raleigh, NC USA*

Lifelong tech-savvy power user & relentless troubleshooter with 4 years of consistent full stack software development experience, as well as 1.5 years now teaching others how they can do it too: from programming fundamentals via modern HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, learning & mastering the text-only user interface via terminal emulators & various shell scripting paradigms, or just merely becoming a more effective, tech-literate user of software in ones work & leisure. I value efficiency, as well as accuracy so, practicing good user/developer routines, habits are a key part of my learning/teaching philosophy.
I work out of a terminal/shell half the time, and I am competent with various operating systems, development environments, commandline tools, internal processes, automated scripts, software configurations, etc.
Others have described me as proactive, analytical, a fast-learner that can work well with others or independently throughout the years, having worked with a wide range of clientele using information technology in some capacity, and most importantly successfully transitioning into a more intellectually demanding profession in recent years with a dual developer/teacher dynamic.
