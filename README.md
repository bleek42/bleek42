Lifelong tech-savvy power user & relentless troubleshooter with 3+ years of consistent full stack web software development experience. Free & Open-Source Software & Linux advocate, often in the terminal but still enjoy the desktop experience regardless of the OS.
Compassionate, yet stern teacher with an emphasis on less slow mouse usage, more fast keyboard usage habits & efficient workflows synchronized with proficient individual programming fundamentals & team-oriented problem solving skills. Execellent in interpersonal & technical literacy skills, as evident from my years of proven experience in the various roles I have held, finding myself to be a trusted technical advisor, reliable communicator, effective collaborator, analytical & compassionate teacher with the humility of a pupil that is determined to find solutions to difficult problems with clients, students, co-workers, & stakeholders alike.
Have an affinity for ReactJS, SASS / SCSS, NodeJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, & various types of shell scripting (Bash/ZSH/Fish/Nu) - and yet, I am always open to learning & mastering new things, as one should be forever teachable in acknowledgement that new problems often require new solutions with the ever-changing technical landscape.
