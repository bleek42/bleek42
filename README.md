## **About**

- A lifelong tech-savvy power user that rarely leaves the terminal/shell I happen to be using on a given day. 4 years of consistent full stack software development experience, 2 years adminstering Linux systems, and 1.5 years teaching university students modern HTML, CSS, & JavaScript in a remote setting. More broadly speaking in both professional or personal capacities, I have been a mentor or advisor to a diverse range of personalities on how they too can become more competent users of software & technology, are capable of troubleshooting or debugging independently, and ultimately increase productivity while decreasing incidents. Observing efficient user/developer habits are a key part of my learning/teaching philosophy, so I put a strong emphasis on fundamentals like practicing keyboard shortcut mastery, using that scary terminal, and sticking with a simple workflow layout!

- Experienced, as well as enthusiastic about, modern full-stack web application development using JavaScript/TypeScript, as well as system administration & developer operations in any environment (AWS, Azure, Linode VMWare, QEMU, bare-metal, etc.) Preferred tech stack to work with includes: React/React-Native/Redux/Next, TypeScript/JSDoc, NodeJS with PNPM, Express/Nest, Linux (Debian/Alpine-based), MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, and Docker. Naturally seeking projects that closely matched tech-stack, yet open to learn & adapt when granted the support to upskill.

- Competent with different operating systems, development environments, commandline tools, internal processes, shell scripting (Bash/ZSH, PWSH, Fish), web/desktop applications, software configurations, remote access, networking & security considerations. More than capable of mentoring as well as learning from colleagues, handling multiple responsibilities, and managing a team effectively. I have been described by others as enthusiastic, proactive, analytical, concise, a fast-learner that values feedback, a patient teacher that makes concepts accessible, while still pushing to ensure a challenging experience that instills long-term mastery.
