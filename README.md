## **About**

- Life-long tech enthusiast, troubleshooter & power-user with 4 years of experience developing modern web software, in addition to 2 years teaching student developers in remote settings. Fluent in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL & NoSQL database paradigms, and a deep understanding of the NodeJS Package Management (NPM) ecosystem.  

- Competent with Windows & Linux-based operating systems, different shell-scripting languages (Bash, ZSH, Fish, Powershell), remote server administration, defensive cyber-security strategies, and otherwise configuring solutions as a use-case requires. High-affinity for modern-contemporary software libraries, frameworks, packages & toolchains, particularly yet not exclusively: React, React-Native, NextJS, TypeScript, JSDoc, Angular, NodeJS, Express, Fastify, NestJS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, tRPC, Docker & Git. Open, even eager to discovering new things as requirements demand, 

- Emphasize ongoing improvements to workflow efficiency with students as they go about their learning path, especially when observing any basic userland-literacy skills that are lacking that I find critical to student success. I stress the importance of becoming a faster & more accurate typist, memorizing fundamental commands, leveraging editor features such as code snippets, tab completions, and anything that encourages best learning practices while also discouraging practices that inhibit learning.

- I have been described by others as proactive, analytical, a quick learner that responds well to constructive criticism, a clear & concise communicator, a patient teacher that explains difficult concepts in an accessible way while still pushing to for a challenging experience that fosters long-term mastery.
