## **About**

- 4 years experience with full stack web application development, 2 years system administration experience, 1.5 years experience teaching modern web application development with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript in a remote setting. Throughout my professional & personal life, a common thread that runs through it describes me as a knowledgable mentor & trusted advisor to a wide range of diverse personalities in some capacity or another when it comes to information technology. I find fulfillment out of tutoring individuals that are motivated, listen to recommendations & suggestions, embrace the feelings of doubt & cluelessness that arise, & put in the time & effort into practicing the skills at hand - often practicing solo, without me there to help! Instilling efficient user/developer habits & routines are a key part of my teaching & learing philosophy, so I put a strong emphasis on the absolute fundamentals on both my students & myself, such as my strong emphasis on routine practice/usage of keyboard shortcuts/binding and typing out commands into the terminal/shell while coding, in an effort to form solid foundations that student developers can build upon.  

- Well-versed in contemporary web development libraries, packages, & frameworks - in particular, I like React/React-Native/Redux/NextJS, TypeScript/JSDoc, NodeJS/PNPM, Express/NestJS, Linux (Debian|Arch|Alpine-based), SQL/NoSQL (MySQL|PostgreSQL|MongoDB|GraphQL) & Docker - as well as system administration & developer operations in just about any environment (cloud: AWS, Azure, Linode; serverless: Vercel, Netlify; virtual: VMWare, QEMU;) Naturally seeking projects that closely match the tech-stack I described, yet alwayus open to learn more & adapt as required when granted the support necessary to up-skill.

- Competent with different operating systems, development environments, commandline tools, internal processes, shell scripting (Bash/ZSH, PWSH, Fish), web/desktop applications, software configurations, remote access, networking & security considerations. More than capable of mentoring as well as learning from colleagues, handling multiple responsibilities, and managing a team effectively. I have been described by others as enthusiastic, proactive, analytical, concise, a fast-learner that values feedback, a patient teacher that makes concepts accessible, while still pushing to ensure a challenging experience that instills long-term mastery.
