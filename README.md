## **About**

- A life-long tech enthusiast, troubleshooter, power-user with 4 years of experience in modern web application development: Fluent in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL / NoSQL, as well as a deep understanding of the NodeJS/NPM package ecosystem, and 2 years teaching student developers in remote settings. Keen on  I emphasize ongoing user-literacy improvements, especially where observed to be lacking early on that I find critical to long-term student success. Strong emphasis on the importance of basic keyboard, shortcut, command line, & editor competencies, using code snippets, certain completion tools, and plenty more that generally encourages making learning a programming language for the first time less intimidating, while still discouraging particular things that often prevent learning.  

- Well-versed with Windows, Linux, various shell scripting languages, package managers, system administration, maintainence, security hardening, and other configurations based on a per use case basis. Deep understanding of contemporary libraries, frameworks, & tools - particularly ReactJS / NextJS / React-Native, TypeScript (or JSDoc), NodeJS, PNPM / Yarn, Express / Fastify / NestJS, SQL, NoSQL  / MongoDB), GraphQL, Docker, Git, VS Code, & Vim. Open, even eager to discovering new things as requirements demand, 

- Others have described me as a fast learner proactive, analytical, engages with good faith constructive criticism, and a patient teacher that makes concepts accessible, while still pushing to ensure a challenging experience & long-term mastery.
