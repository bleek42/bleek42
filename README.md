## **About**

- Lifelong tech-savvy power user with 4 years of consistent full stack software development experience, as well as 1.5 years now teaching university students modern HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, as well as generally becoming a better user of software when performing tasks and is able to troubleshoot, debug, improve, and produce solutions with independence & competence. Observing efficient user/developer habits & routines are a key part of my learning/teaching philosophy, and I emphasize fundamentals such as keyboard shortcut mastery early on.

- Advanced to intermediate knowledge & understanding of modern full stack web development. Specific tech stack skills include (but certainly never limited to) React/Native/Redux/NextJS, TypeScript/JSDoc, NodeJS, NPM/Yarn/PNPM, Express/NestJS, Linux, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, & Docker. Naturally seeking projects that closely matched tech-stack, yet open to learn & adapt if granted the support to learn & grow.
  
- Competent with various operating systems, development environments, commandline tools, internal processes, shell scripting, web/desktop applications, software configurations, remote access, networking & security considerations. Capable of managing a team, taking on multiple responsibilities when necessary. I have been described by others as enthusiastic, proactive, analytical, concise, a fast-learner that values teamwork, a patient teacher that makes concepts accessible to students while still pushing to ensure a challenging experience.
